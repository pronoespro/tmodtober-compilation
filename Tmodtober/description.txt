The ultimate compilation of the mods I made for a self-imposed challenge called "Tmodtober" in which I attempted to make a mod for every day of the month.
This is the version that has a lot of fixes and balancing changes done to it, the original mods are still up.
Also, this version will get more updates if you think something is broken or not working as intended and leave a comment, thanks!

I failed at the last day with the last mod and it took me more than a week to finish it.
Anyways, enjoy!
